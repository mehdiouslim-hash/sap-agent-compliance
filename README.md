# SAP Agent Compliance

This project explores an agentic AI system designed to monitor regulatory changes
(financial and tax regulations) and assess their potential impact on SAP systems.

## Problem
Regulatory documents are long, complex, and frequently updated.
Manual monitoring is slow, error-prone, and difficult to audit.

## Goal
- Detect regulatory changes over time
- Compare document versions
- Produce clear, human-readable compliance reports

## What this project does NOT do
- No automatic SAP postings
- No financial decisions without human validation

## Current status
Step 1: Project setup and collection of real regulatory PDFs.
